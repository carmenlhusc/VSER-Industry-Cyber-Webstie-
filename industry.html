              <h3>WHAT IS THE HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY?</h3>
              <p>The Healthcare Industry is the industry that houses all things healthcare. This industry is responsible for providing services, products, and systems that caters to the well-being of humans. Think of the healthcare industry as hospitals, clinics, ambulances, health education, and so much more!

              <h3>WHAT IS AN INTEGRATION ENGINEER?</h3>
              <p>An Integration Engineer that works within the EPIC EHR Software is responsible for bridging the gap between healthcare and tech. These individuals ensure many different software systems are implemented into the business correctly and efficiently! These individuals can also be seen designing, testing, validating, documenting, and developing theses software systems.  </p>
           </div>
           <div>
               <h3>ETHICAL ISSUES THAT MAY ARISE?</h3>
            </p>An ethical issue that may arise within the position of an Integration Engineer are privacy issues. Due to EPIC being an electric health record system (EHR), Integration Engineers working within this industry may violate HIPPAA laws and share private patient information that should not be shared for their own benefit.</p>
           <div>
               <h3>CYBERSECURITY ISSUES THAT MAY ARISE?</h3>
               <p>Two cybersecurity issues that may arise within EPIC EHR Systems are insider threats and unauthorized network access. Insider threats are dangerous because there might be people that have this role and use it soley for malicious intent. These people might sell patient information for monetary benefit. Unauthorized Network Access is also extremely dangerous because hackers can get ahold of these systems through these weak network points. This can also lead to data leaks, or HIPPA violations.</p> 
           </div>
           <div> 
               <h3>BEST CYBERSECURITY PRACTICES?</h3>
               <p>Within the healthcare system, patient privacy is extremely important, as seen by HIPPAA laws. Combining the two industries calls for strong cybersecurty practices such as, data protection or encryption, network security - to minimize outside access to sensitive information and threats, access control - to minimze access to senstive information, disaster recovery strategies - to restore important information.</p>
