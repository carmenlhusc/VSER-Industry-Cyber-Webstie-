           </div>
              <h3>1. RESPECT </h3>
              <p>Respect is important to me because it means treating other people as humans. Respect means listening to them, honoring them, paying attention to them, and so much more. </p>
              <p>Being a South Carolina native, respect has been engraved into me. This looks like saying "Yes Ma'am/Sir" and "No Ma'am/Sir" to elders, giving others your undivided attention, and always showing that infamous southern hospitality. </p>
           <div>
           <div>
              <h3>2. HONESTY</h3>
              <p>Honesty is important to me because there is nothing worse than believing something someone has said to now realizing that what they said was untrue. In my opinion, lying is pointless. To me, it's is important to be true to who you are and what you say.</p>
              <p>This is another value that has been engraved into me as a southerner. So this value stems from the culture I'm surrounded by back home, home being Charleston, SC. </p>
           </div>
           <div>
               <h3>3. COMMUNICATION</h3>
               <p>Communication is important to me because most problems we face can be solved with a conversation. Good communication combines my other top personal values, respect and honesty. Some conversations are hard but it's important to have them because how else will we know and understand other people's opinions. </p>
               <p>I developed this value simply by being a teenager in 2025. Most of the issues we see in society can be resolved with a conversation.... and money of course.</p>
           <div>
               <h3>4. HUMILITY</h3>
               <p>It is important to be humble because being prideful can ruin a lot of deep and honest conversations with others. When your head it too big, it can also ruin a lot of opportunities for things like growth or even potential jobs.</p> 
               <p>Growing up, my parents always engraved in my siblings and I's brains that it is just as important to be humble as it is to have respect for others. Sometimes pride can trick your brain into thinking others aren't human with their own life experiences.</p>
           </div>
           <div> 
               <h3> CONSEQUENCES OF NOT ADHERING TO THESE VALUES</h3>
               <p> I feel as though these four values are non-negotiable when it comes to being an overall decent human being. It is important to have repsect for others, be honest, communicate, and be humble in all aspects of life. You never know who you could be talking to and you never know what someone else may be going through.   </p>
